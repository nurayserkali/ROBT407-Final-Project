### General Info
***
We tested out 5 machine learning algorithms on a voice dataset to compare and find the accuracies of gender voice recognition. 

## Dataset
The "Gender Recognition by Voice: Identify a voice as male or female" dataset from Kaggle was used to train and test the models.

## Files
***
#### Final_project_last_version_1.ipynb
This file includes the data loading, data preprocessing by finding the correlations and concatination of the data features. Then training the data using Scikit-learn Library models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest was conducted. This file also includes the implementation of a DNN model by TensorFlow library. At the end of the file, implementation of two different data visualization models to demonstrate the results (Bar chart to compare the 10-Fold CV and test scores, Confusion Matrices for the heat maps of the test and predicted data comparance) for the above mentioned 5 models.
